The '''guitar''' is a [[stringed musical instrument]] that is usually fretted (with [[Fretless guitar|some exceptions]]) and typically has six or [[Twelve-string guitar|twelve strings]]. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by [[strumming]] or [[Plucked string instrument|plucking]] the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against [[frets]] with the fingers of the opposite hand. A [[guitar pick]] may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant hollow chamber on the guitar, or amplified by an electronic [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] and an [[guitar amplifier|amplifier]].

The guitar is classified as a [[chordophone]], meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched between two fixed points.  Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood, with its strings made of [[catgut]]. Steel guitar strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States,<ref name="smogyipremier">{{cite web |last1=Somogyi |first1=Ervin |title=Tracking The Steel-String Guitar's Evolution, Pt. 1 |url=https://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Tracking_The_Steel_String_Guitars_Evolution_Pt_1 |website=premierguitar.com |publisher=Premier Guitar Magazine |access-date=February 27, 2021 |date=January 7, 2011}}</ref> but nylon and steel strings became mainstream only following [[World War II]].<ref name="smogyipremier"/> The guitar's ancestors include the [[gittern]], the [[vihuela]], the four-[[course (music)|course]] [[Renaissance guitar]], and the five-course [[baroque guitar]], all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.

There are three main types of modern guitar: the [[classical guitar]] (Spanish guitar); the [[steel-string acoustic guitar]] or [[electric guitar]]; and the [[Lap steel guitar|Hawaiian guitar]] (played  across the player's lap). Traditional acoustic guitars include the [[flat top guitar]] (typically with a large sound hole) or the [[archtop guitar]], which is sometimes called a "[[jazz guitar]]". The tone of an acoustic guitar is produced by the strings' vibration, amplified by the hollow body of the guitar, which acts as a [[Helmholtz resonance|resonating chamber]]. The classical [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] is often played as a [[solo (music)|solo]] instrument using a comprehensive [[fingerstyle]] technique where each string is plucked individually by the player's fingers, as opposed to being strummed. The term "finger-picking" can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues, bluegrass, and country guitar playing in the United States.

[[Electric guitar]]s, first patented in 1937,<ref name="history-channel">{{cite web|title=First-ever electric guitar patent awarded to the Electro String Corporation|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-ever-electric-guitar-patent-awarded-to-the-electro-string-corporation|website=history.com|publisher=A&E Television Networks|access-date=September 20, 2017}}</ref> use a [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] and [[guitar amplifier|amplifier]] that made the instrument loud enough to be heard, but also enabled manufacturing guitars with a solid block of wood needing a resonant chamber.<ref name="beauchamp">{{cite web|title=The Earliest Days of the Electric Guitar |url=http://www.rickenbacker.com/history_early.asp |website=rickenbacker.com |publisher=Rickenbacker International |access-date=September 7, 2017}}</ref>  A wide array of electronic [[effects unit]]s became possible including [[reverb effect|reverb]] and [[distortion (music)|distortion (or "overdrive")]]. [[Solid body guitars|Solid-body guitars]] began to dominate the guitar market during the 1960s and 1970s; they are less prone to unwanted [[acoustic feedback]]. As with acoustic guitars, there are a number of types of electric guitars, including [[Semi-acoustic guitar|hollowbody guitars]], [[archtop guitar]]s (used in [[jazz guitar]], [[blues]] and [[rockabilly]]) and [[Solid body|solid-body guitar]]s, which are widely used in [[rock music]].

The loud, amplified sound and sonic power of the electric guitar played through a guitar amp have played a key role in the development of [[blues]] and [[rock music]], both as an [[accompaniment]] instrument (playing [[riff]]s and [[chord (music)|chord]]s) and performing [[guitar solo]]s, and in many rock subgenres, notably [[heavy metal music]] and [[punk rock]]. The electric guitar has had a major influence on [[popular culture]]. The guitar is used in a wide variety of musical genres worldwide. It is recognized as a primary instrument in genres such as [[blues]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[flamenco]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], [[jota (music)|jota]], [[ska]], [[mariachi]], [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[rock music|rock]], [[grunge]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[acoustic music]], [[disco]], [[new wave music|new wave]], [[new age music|new age]], [[adult contemporary music]], and [[pop music|pop]], occasionally used as a sample in [[hip-hop]], [[dubstep]], or [[trap music]].
